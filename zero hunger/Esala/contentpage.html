                    <h2>1.Infrastructure Deficiencies</h2>
                    <p>Inadequate infrastructure impedes the efficient distribution of food, causing delays, higher expenses, and losses after harvest, particularly in poor nations. To get over these obstacles, infrastructure development investments are essential.</p>

                <div class="para-2">
                    <h2>2.Supply Chain Disruptions</h2>
                    <p>Modern food supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions due to global events like pandemics, natural disasters, and economic crises. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for robust distribution networks, requiring increased flexibility, diversification, and backup plans.</p>

                    <h2>3.Logistical Challenges</h2>
                    <P>Poor logistics in food distribution can lead to delays, increased costs, and spoilage. Improving planning, technology, and infrastructure can enhance efficiency and prevent significant food losses.</P>
                </div>
                <div class="para-4">
                    <h2>4.Climate Change and Environmental Factors</h2>
                    <p>Climate change impacts food distribution by disrupting supply chains, causing extreme weather events, and affecting agricultural productivity. To address these challenges, robust adaptation and mitigation strategies are needed to build resilient food distribution networks.</p>
