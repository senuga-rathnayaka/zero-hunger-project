            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Zero Hunger is one of the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were created in
                2015. It's officially known as SDG 2. The objective is to eradicate hunger, achieve food security,
                enhance nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030</p>

        <div id="causes" class="section">
            <h2>Causes of Hunger</h2>
            <p>Poverty is the primary cause of hunger, as it limits access to sufficient healthy food. Conflict and
                political instability destabilize food production and delivery. Climate change and natural calamities,
                such as droughts and floods, decimate crops and food supply. Many individuals lack access to basic
                resources such as land and farming equipment. Inequitable food distribution systems, as well as food
                waste, contribute to food insecurity. Populations are weakened due to health difficulties and
                malnutrition. Limited knowledge and skills impede efficient resource usage. Addressing these issues
                necessitates coordinated measures to promote economic growth, improve food distribution, strengthen
                resilience to climate effects, and empower communities.</p>

        <div id="solutions" class="section">
            <h2>Solutions to Hunger</h2>
            <p>To successfully tackle hunger, we must prioritize economic growth by reducing poverty and increasing
                buying power. Investing in sustainable agriculture, including research and infrastructure, increases
                food production and adaptability to climate change. Food aid and cash transfers are examples of social
                protection programs that offer safety nets to needy communities. Nutrition and hygiene education
                enhances health outcomes, and efficient food delivery systems decrease waste while ensuring fair access.
                To achieve long-term food security, peace-building initiatives and environmental sustainability must be
                combined with community empowerment and international collaboration.</p>

                advocating for policy changes, and raising awareness about hunger issues in your community.</p>
