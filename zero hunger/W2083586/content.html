                <h2>1. Infrastructure Deficiencies</h2>
                <p>Inadequate infrastructure hinders efficient food distribution, resulting in delays, increased costs, and post-harvest losses, especially in poorer regions. Addressing this requires investments in infrastructure development.</p>

                <h2>2. Supply Chain Disruptions</h2>
                <p>Modern food supply chains are susceptible to disruptions from global events such as pandemics, natural disasters, and economic crises. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for resilient distribution networks that are flexible, diversified, and equipped with backup plans.</p>

                <h2>3. Logistical Challenges</h2>
                <p>Poor logistics contribute to delays, higher expenses, and food spoilage during distribution. Enhancing planning, adopting new technologies, and improving infrastructure are crucial steps to increase efficiency and reduce food losses.</p>

                <h2>4. Climate Change and Environmental Factors</h2>
                <p>Climate change affects food distribution by disrupting supply chains, causing extreme weather events, and impacting agricultural productivity. Addressing these challenges requires robust strategies for adaptation and mitigation to build resilient food distribution networks.</p>
